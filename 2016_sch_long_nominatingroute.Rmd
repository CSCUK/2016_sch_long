This document relates to `r SurveyName` and is a intended as a short overview of basic findings by a key variable. Figures in tables are proportions (%) of the total (e.g. 89% of Split site Scholars replied 'Often') unless otherwise stated. For more detailed interpretation or explanation of the figures, please contact the evaluation team: [evaluation@cscuk.org.uk](mailto:evaluation@cscuk.org.uk)

# 1. Data overview

Counts of cases are not typically shown in the results tables; note should taken where the table below indicates few respondents in a particular category.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
overview_sch %>% 
  select(-Variable,Route=Response,Cases=freq, 'Proportion (%)'=prop) %>% 
  pander
```

# 2. Current residency

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bind_rows(rescountry_sch,resregion_sch) %>% 
  filter(Response=="Home") %>% 
  select(-freq, -Response, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  mutate(Variable = fct_recode(Variable, "Country"="resStatusCountry","Region"="resStatusRegion")) %>% 
  spread(Variable, prop) %>% 
  pander
```

# 3. Employment

Employment status:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
empcurrent_sch %>% 
  select(-freq,-Variable) %>% 
  mutate(Response = fct_recode(Response, "Other" = "Neither employed nor studying")) %>% 
  spread(Response, prop) %>% 
  select(Route=SchemeNom, Employed, contains("Employed and studying"),Studying, Other) %>% 
  pander
```

Current sector of employment of Scholars (Note: percentages may not sum to 100%: proportions are of all Scholars in each category, including any not currently employed):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
empsector_sch %>% 
  select(-freq,-Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  spread(Response, prop) %>% 
  pander
```

# 4. Further qualificiations

Study of additional qualifications in last two years. Note: be cautious of low size for groups distorting figures for these questions.

Respondents who had undertaken additional qualifications since completing their Commonwealth Scholarship:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
acapostaward_sch %>% 
  filter(Response=="Yes") %>%
  arrange(desc(prop)) %>% 
  select( -Response,-Variable,  Route=SchemeNom,"Proportion (%)"=prop,"Cases"=freq) %>% 
  pander
```

Level of qualification studied (each level is shown as a proportion of respondents who had undertaken additional qualifications):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
acaquallevel_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  select(Route=SchemeNom, Doctorate,contains("Master's degree"),contains("Professional accreditation"),contains("Technical training"),
         contains("Undergraduate degree"), Other) %>% 
  pander
```

# 5. Leadership activities

Workplace related leadership activities:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bind_rows(ldrbudget_sch, ldrmanaging_sch, ldrsupervise_sch,ldrstrategy_sch) %>% 
  filter(Response=="Yes") %>% 
  select(-freq, -Response, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  mutate(Variable = fct_recode(Variable,"Overseeing budgets"="LdrBudget","Managing Company / department" = "LdrManaging",
                               "Setting strategy"="LdrStrategy","Supervising others"="LdrSupervising")) %>% 
  spread(Variable, prop) %>% 
  pander
```

# 6. Skill application

Use of skills from Scholarship in various circumstances. Divided into three overall groups: Use of skills, knowledge transfer, and advocating for change.

__[6.1] Use of skills__

Three variables constitute the 'use of skills' group: application of skills learned during your studies in the workplace; application of skills learned during your studies outside of the workplace; and approaching a problem differently based on something learned during your studies.

Use of skills in the workplace:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
appskillwork_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

Use of skills outside of the workplace:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
appskillnonwork_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

Approach a problem differently:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
appapproach_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

__[6.2] Knowledge transfer__

Two variables constitute the 'knowledge transfer' group: teaching a colleague something learned during your studies and developing training resources for others based something learned during your studies.

Teaching a colleague:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
apptrain_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

Developing training resources:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
appresources_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

__[6.3] Advocacy and influencing change__

Two variables constitute the 'advocacy and influencing change' group: Encouraging senior managers to make change based on something learned during your studies and making a change to your organisation's working practice based on something learned during your studies.

Encouraging senior managers to make change:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
appadvocate_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

Personally making a change to organisational practice:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
appchange_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

# 7. Research activity

Overall involvement in academic research:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
resmain_sch %>% 
  filter(Response=="Yes") %>%
  arrange(desc(prop)) %>% 
  select(-Response,-Variable, Route=SchemeNom,Cases=freq, "Proportion (%)"=prop) %>% 
  pander
```

__[7.1] Academic Productivity__

Results do not sum to 100% in each row because some Scholars are not involved in academic research activity at all: these respondents are excluded from the table, but the proportions shown are based on all Scholars within each category, not _only_ Scholars involved in academic research. The category "Never" thus means a Scholar who has indicated involvement in academic research generally, but has indicated that they are never involved in this specific academic activity (e.g. publishing journal articles). This applies to "7.1. Academic Productivity" and "7.3. Research Collaboration".

Publishing journal articles:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rescomparticles_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>%
  pander
```

Involvement in academic projects:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rescompprojects_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>% 
  pander

```

Applying for grants / funding:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rescompfunding_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>% 
  pander

```

__[7.2] Academic community activities__

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bind_rows(reseditor_sch,resreviewer_sch,resorganiser_sch) %>% 
  filter(Response=="Yes") %>% 
  select(-freq,-Response) %>%
  spread(Variable, prop) %>% 
  select(Route=SchemeNom,"Journal Editor"=ResEditor,"Peer reviewer"=ResReviewer,"Conference organiser" = ResOrganiser) %>%
  pander

```

__[7.3] International collaboration__ 

Research activities with colleagues from outside Scholar's country of origin or based outisde the Scholar's country of origin.


Collaborative authorship of papers:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rescollabauthor_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>% 
  pander

```

Collaborative applications for grants:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

rescollabgrant_sch %>% 
  select(-freq, -Variable, Route=SchemeNom) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  spread(Response,prop) %>% 
  pander

```

Attendance at international conferences:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

rbind(teachschool_sch,teachundergrad_sch,teachpostgrad_sch,teachdoctorate_sch,teachtvet_sch) %>% 
  filter(Response=="Yes") %>%
